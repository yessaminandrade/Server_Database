## Project Overview

### Project purpose:

The project involves automating the integration of information about researchers and published articles at a university by using the Google Scholar API to retrieve relevant data on researchers and research papers. This system must enable efficient integration with the institutionâ€™s research database.

### Key functionalities:

Query Google Scholar (via SerpApi) for:

- Articles (titles, links, venues, years, citation info when available)
- Author profiles (names, affiliations, citation metrics)
- Filter and customize searches (language, year ranges, pagination).

### Project relevance:

This project eliminates manual copy/paste from Google Scholar and standardizes how data is collected. It streamlines integration with institutional systems (researcher registry, publications catalog, KPIs) and helps maintain current, consistent metadata for reporting and analytics.

### The technical report for the Google Scholar API is included in this repository.
It covers: Endpoints, Authentication, Query parameters, Response formats, Usage limits, and Code examples.
